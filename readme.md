# 100 Lines or Less

I'd love to start a youtube series where we do live programming and implement interesting functionality is 100 lines or less. This is my repository to prove out this idea. I want to add a bunch of example programs here to show that I really can take this idea fairly far.

## Rules

1. No library may exceed 100 lines of code.
2. No code golfing.
3. Try not to use third party libraries.

## Things to keep in mind

* Any previously written 100 line or less libraries are fair game
* Try to use as many languages as possible
* Try not to be a language snob
* More about standalone functionality than an algorithm

## Things to consider

* If a library was written in one language should I make a video rewriting it another?
    * This may be interesting if the implementations are different.
    * This may give a wider audience.
    * This may show the strengths of some languages.
    * This may bore people.
* If this got popular, what would streaming these look like?
* How often should I make videos?
* How long should a video be?
* Where can I get a quiet enough space to record these?
